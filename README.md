# Intra-Factory Maglev Train
An attempt at implementing a small to medium scale local train system for factorio.
This is meant as a medium throughput alternative for trains in highly distributed bases.

Pros of this system compared to regular trains are:
  - More compact, allowing for easier integration within existing bases without having to redesign your base from ground up.
  - Allows to transport not only items but power and signals.
  - Same level of logistics control as regular trains.
  
Cons of the system compared to regular trains are:
  - Locked behind purple science.
  - More expensive to setup.
  - Limited throughput - mostly meant as a replacement for 1-1 trains.
